Due to high rise of autism patients diagnoised at a late stage, I collaborated with an open source community- Omdena, to build a Deep Learning model which detects ASD traits (Autism Disorder) among toddlers not more than 3 years old.
The model which operates on an accuracy of 82% is intended to aid over 20 hospitals in india in promptly identifying early signs of autism in children

This repository contains:
* the certificate of participation from Omdena,
* a personal powerpoint presentation of the model built and its efficiency,
* the notebook that contains the model developemnt and
* the EDA notebook
